# Line-Following-Robot

A first year project for the UWaterloo Robotics Club

In this project, we integrated motors and sensors with a Teensy microcontroller with a simple circuit design.

To allow the robot to follow a track autonomously, an algorithm was designed to control the robot motors based on sensor readings.

## Here are some pictures of our line following robot:
